I am interested in the internal structure of words(phonology and morphology), how they are processed in the brain (psycholinguistics), and how they change over time (historical linguistics). 

I am currently a Departmental Lecturer in Phonology at the University of Oxford. My teaching includes general linguistics, phonology and historical linguistics. I am also an Associate Lecturer in Education at Oxford Brookes, where I teach phonetics, phonology and morphology

In terms of my research, my recent work has focused on the phonological typology of modern Arabic varieties with regards to syllable structure, stress, and affixation. I also explore the psycholinguistic processing of complex words through psycholinguistic experiments. 

Outside of linguistics, I enjoy crochet, strategy board games, and fantasy fiction.

At an excellent Software Carpentry workshop on Bash, I wondered how these skills would be useful to me. 
How scientists could use programming in their research seemed clear - but in Linguistics, if you don't do -computational- research?

Several years later, I have put these skills to good use - so here is a compilation. In time, I'll add links to the code for some of these.

## PYTHON
- Automate the creation of 15 experiment run files
- Webscraping a turkish corpus to get word frequency counts 
- Identifying the difference between two cognates and their phonological features
- Creating my own work, food and exercise loggers
- Dividing words into morphemes
	
## BASH 
- Moving and copying files without errors
- Reminder GUIs to take breaks
- Text replacement
- Copying all lines that start with a particular code to a new file
- Code to open different programs/websites depending on the time of day (to open my work things 9-5)

## PRAAT
- Autofilling text grids
- Cutting out sounds into individual .wav files
	
## AUTOHOTKEY
- Shortcuts to open my favourite files, programs and websites
- Text replace for my (email) address, phone number, common emails, common misspellings
	
## EXCEL VBA
- Code to check if a word overlaps in the first sound within ten rows
- Code to check if word exhibits vowel harmony

## LATEX
- Slides for teaching and conference presentations
- Handouts
- Conference abstracts
- My MPhil and DPhil theses and submitted work

	
All in all, totally worth it

# Autohotkey
- [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
    + I use this for keyboard shortcuts to open frequently used programs, files, websites and more.

# Other Resources
- [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/) has a wide range of resources for acquiring, transforming, analysing, presenting and sustaining data
    + this includes web scraping!
- [Free Code Camp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) covers responsive web design, javascript, front end libraries, data visualisation, APIs and microservices, and information security
- Sherry Chen (a former Oxford linguist) has an excellent array of resources on her [website](https://sherrychen.org/resources) for LaTeX, Python, Statistics, Ibex Farm etc
- [Raul Pacheco-Vega](http://www.raulpacheco.org/blog/) has a wealth of research/reading techniques and other useful resources
